# Event Ticketing System

You are tasked with designing a system to manage ticket sales for various types of events, such as concerts, sports games, and theatre performances. Each event can have different pricing models (e.g., standard pricing, discounted pricing for students or seniors, and dynamic pricing based on demand). Additionally, tickets may need to be printed or delivered digitally.

### Your Task:

Design an object-oriented solution for the ticketing system. Your solution should allow the system to:

1. Handle different types of events with varying ticket pricing models.
2. Apply different discount strategies (e.g., student, senior, promotional) to tickets.
3. Provide a way to deliver tickets (e.g., physical printing or digital delivery).
4. Allow for flexibility in adding new types of events or ticket delivery methods in the future.

### Expectations:

- Ensure that your design follows the SOLID principles to promote maintainability and scalability.
- Avoid hardcoding the pricing or delivery methods directly into the event classes.
- Consider how you would manage adding new pricing strategies or delivery methods without modifying existing code.
